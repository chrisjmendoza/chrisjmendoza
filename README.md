⭐ Chris Mendoza — Android (Kotlin/Compose) & Python Automation Developer

Hi, I’m Chris, a developer who loves turning complex engineering workflows into clean, reliable software.
My focus is Android development with Kotlin + Jetpack Compose and Python automation—especially tools that make real-world processes work smoother, from mobile UI features to OCR pipelines and system utilities.

I enjoy solving problems that mix structure, precision, and creativity.
If something needs to be debugged, refactored, automated, or rebuilt cleanly… that’s my wheelhouse.
